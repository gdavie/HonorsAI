# This is my README
This is a Fork of the HCPLGP work.
Symbolic Regression will be attempted from here, using the PLGP architecture.
Initially it will be set up with a single factor (ie LGP but using PLGP package), and will look at the situation from there.

Should different parts of the equation be requred, we can look at parallel factors, maybe in an ensemble approach. Maybe even 
coeveolution could be useful.... but a much better understanding of the domain will be required.\
