\begin{abstract}

Standard regression techniques for soil analysis are time consuming and subject to human bias. The Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS) and Victoria University have developed a proof of concept prototype as a solution to this problem, Evolutionary Spatial Auto-Correlation (ESPAC). ESPAC is an implementation of the parallel linear genetic programming (PLGP) algorithm. Due to the nature of this project no alternative solutions were investigated. This project aims to address this issue by investigating the properties of other GP based artificial intelligence techniques. The aim to lend strength to the argument that PLGP is the correct solution to the problem, or find that an alternative method would be more viable, all within the time restrictions of a 4th year honors project.
